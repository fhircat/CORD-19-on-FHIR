# CORD-19-on-FHIR -- Semantics for COVID-19 Discovery

CORD-19-on-FHIR is a Linked Data version of the 
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset [(CORD-19)](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) data, provided by the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/) to support research on COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 / Novel Coronavirus.  It is represented 
in [FHIR RDF](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html)
and was produced by data mining the CORD-19 dataset and adding semantic annotations.  The purpose is to facilitate linkage with other biomedical datasets and enable answering research questions.

## Semantic annotations

So far, CORD-19-on-FHIR adds the following semantic annotations to the CORD-19 dataset, based only on parsing the titles and abstracts.See an **RDF turtle** example [here](https://github.com/fhircat/CORD-19-on-FHIR/blob/master/examples/sample_0036b28fddf7e93da0970303672934ea2f9944e7.json.ttl). A number of **sparql queries** to identify the instances of different data types are aviable at [here](https://github.com/fhircat/CORD-19-on-FHIR/wiki/SPARQL-Queries). 

- Condition: 182,231 instances
- Medication: 32,069 instances
- Procedure: 100,260 instances

We plan to parse the full text articles soon, for those that we can access.  

If you can generate other semantic linkages, please let us know.  Collaboration is invited.  Please issue a pull request or contact Guoqian Jiang <jiang.guoqian@mayo.edu> and Harold Solbrig <solbrig@jhu.edu>.


## Pubtator annotations

We have also added another set of annotations from [Pubtator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/).  These are pulled from the Pubtator API via pmcid (PubMed Central id) from metadata file (see below).  Not all PMC ids yielded annotations.  These annotations have been converted from the source JSON into RDF Turtle format. 

### CORD-19 Dataset

We have produced a linked version of the dataset. See an **RDF turtle** example [here](https://github.com/fhircat/CORD-19-on-FHIR/blob/master/examples/PMC212558_t.ttl). A number of **sparql queries** to identify the instances of different data types are aviable at [here](https://github.com/fhircat/CORD-19-on-FHIR/wiki/PubTator-Dataset).

- Species:       2,030,458 instances
- Gene:          1,235,829 instances
- Disease:       1,036,954 instances
- Chemical:      778,872 instances
- CellLine:      76,816 instances
- Mutation:      33,413 instances
- Strain:        26,573 instances

### LitCovid Dataset

[LitCovid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific information about the 2019 novel Coronavirus. It is the most comprehensive resource on the subject, providing a central access to 3207 (and growing) relevant articles in PubMed. We have produced a linked version of the dataset. A number of **sparql queries** to identify the instances of different data types are aviable at [here](https://github.com/fhircat/CORD-19-on-FHIR/wiki/LitCovid-Dataset).

- Species	34,945
- Disease	29,106
- Chemical	4,718
- Gene	43,82
- CellLine	460
- Mutation	117


## Ontologies

We are developing the COVID-19 PICO Ontology (CPICO) that is an extension of Cochrane PICO Ontology for supporting COVID-19 evidence extraction and formulating COVID-19 research questions. The CPICO Ontology defines specific subtypes for the PICO classes of Population, Intervention, and Outcome. See details [here](https://github.com/fhircat/CORD-19-on-FHIR/tree/master/ontologies).

## License

This dataset was derived from the CORD-19 dataset, and therefore consists of two subsets, having different licenses, that are intermingled in the CORD-19-on-FHIR dataset:

- the CORD-19 dataset, subject to the CORD-19 license; and

- semantic annotations that were added by CORD-19-on-FHIR data mining, subject to a CC0 license.
